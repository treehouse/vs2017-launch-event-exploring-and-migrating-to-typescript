## Notes

__Goal: Introduce developers to TypeScript, the process of migrating JS to TS, and the JavaScript editor improvements in VS 2017__

_"In this module, you'll learn the basics of the TypeScript language and how to incrementally migrate a project to TypeScript. You'll also see how Visual Studio 2017 leverages the TypeScript Language Service to provide a rich JavaScript development experience including features such as symbol-based navigation, statement completion, and code refactoring. And you'll see how to use JSDoc comments and TypeScript Declaration (d.ts) files to refine the TypeScript Language Service's understanding of your code."_

* Avoid talking about the "Visual Studio launch event"
* Avoid talking about "the recent release of Visual Studio 2017"
* Don't worry about "Welcome back" type language – each module stands on its own

## Welcome

* Hi there! My name is James
* In this module, we'll explore the TypeScript language and learn how to migrate existing JavaScript to TypeScript using VS 2017

### Setting Expectations

* I'm going to assume in this module that you have a basic understanding of JavaScript and some experience with using Visual Studio

## About Me

* Teacher at Treehouse (teamtreehouse.com)
* 16 years of professional development experience working with a wide variety of client and server technologies
* Regional speaker and trainer for organizations throughout Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, and Tennessee

## Agenda

* Introduction
* Demo: VS 2017 JavaScript Editor
* Demo: Introducing TypeScript
* Demo: Migrating to TypeScript
* Wrap Up

## Introduction

### Current Situation

* Application with a code base that has organically grown over months or years
* Code is relatively clean but the team is afraid to make anything than a minor change
* If you're not careful JavaScript can become a "write-only" language
 * Especially if you don't have good unit test code coverage or tooling support

### What Do We Need?

* Better tooling support to prevent simple mistakes
* Improved code discoverability and navigation
* Support ability to refactor
* Leverage newer JS features

### Possible Solutions

* Testing
* Tooling
* Static Typing

### TypeScript

* Superset of JavaScript
* Optional static typing
* Features from the future

### Incremental Migration

* Not an "all or nothing" proposition
* Migrate as you want to or have time
